+ Platform agnostic
  - Using the power of polymorphism, the framework should be able to support
+ You only pay for what you actually use.
  - Meaning, your binary size should not include any data that does not
    actually get used in your code
  - There should exist slim alternatives to modules within frame work. (example threadsafe::I2c vs lpc40xx::I2c, if you don't want or need threadsafe you shouldn't have to pay for it.)
+ Tested & Testable
+ Fast and simple build system
  - One of the most irritating things about developing with firmware is the turn around time it takes to build and reflash code on the device. SJSU-Dev2 is built up to reduce the number of compilation units and heavy libraries to make compilation blazing fast.
+ Impartial - its a framework but it doesn't tell you what to do
+
